Media-LibMTP-API
================

Media-LibMTP-API is a Perl module that provides a low-level interface to [libmtp](http://libmtp.sourceforge.net), which is an Initiator implementation of the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) in the form of a library suitable primarily for POSIX compliant operating systems.

libmtp is not included with Media-LibMTP-API; you must install it separately.
