Media-LibMTP-API version {{$version}}, released {{$date}}


You probably want to use Media-LibMTP instead of using this module
directly.

This module provides a low-level interface to LibMTP, which is an
Initiator implementation of the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) in the
form of a library suitable primarily for POSIX compliant operating
systems.

LibMTP is not included; you must install it separately.

See http://libmtp.sourceforge.net for details.
